Description and How To Use
==========================
1. Tree Traversal- Turns a list of numbers into a tree, and uses
two methods (preOrderTraversal and inOrderTraversal) to "traverse"
the tree. To run, hit run. To do more testing, create a list of 
numbers. If you want empty spots in the tree, use None for the 
positions that would be left empty. Then use a variable to hold
the lenght of the list. Then create a root and initialize it
using the populateTree function with the correct parameters. Then 
to see the output, create a list and initialize it with the
inorderTraversal or preorderTraversal method, and print out
each number in the list.
2. Sorted_Priority_Queue- This file uses a bunch of classes to 
create a sorted priority queue. It take a list of key(unsorted),
value pairs, and uses an insertion sort add method to add to the 
priority queue in a sorted manner. To run, hit run. To do more 
testing, create a SortedPrioritQueue object. Then call the add
function to add key-value pairs. Then create a list and use
the addList function to add all the pairs to the list in order.
Print out the contents of the list to verify that it worked.
